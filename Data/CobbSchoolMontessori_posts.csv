"Cobb Alum Spotlight: Lizzy Strapp 
A proud Cobb graduate, Lizzy recently earned her degree from Dartmouth College, where she double majored in English and Classics. During her time at Dartmouth, she also captained the women’s club soccer team and served as the sisterhood chair for her sorority, Kappa Delta Epsilon.
This July, Lizzy is headed to Boston to begin her new role as an underwriting and claims associate with Berkley Environmental, a Berkley Company.

“Anytime Troy and Circus Smirkus visited! I learned to juggle and walk on the rolling globe—it was a giant ball you stood on. I’ll never forget it!”

"Student-Led Recycling Challenge Makes a Global Impact!  Two of our inspiring Upper Elementary students, Lucas and Pablo, launched a school-wide recycling challenge, and it was a huge success! 
Each Elementary classroom joined in the fun, with weekly tallies and a bit of friendly competition to collect bottles and cans for a good cause. For two months, Lucas and Pablo diligently counted every contribution, plus a few generous cash donations, and raised an amazing $300! 
The funds will be donated to three organizations in Colombia:
 a local hospital
 a nonprofit supporting the blind
 an organization serving vulnerable girls

"Happy Juneteenth! Today we honor Juneteenth, a powerful reminder of resilience, liberation, and the ongoing pursuit of justice. On June 19, 1865—nearly three years after the Emancipation Proclamation—Union troops arrived in Galveston Bay, Texas, bringing word of freedom to more than 250,000 Black Americans who were still enslaved.
Juneteenth marks the effective end of slavery in the United States and stands as a celebration of Black freedom, culture, and community, as well as a continued call to action for equity and justice for all.

Motivated yet humble, she brings warmth and positivity to every space she enters.

"A toddler’s quiet joy in lining up boots and shoes isn’t just adorable, it’s deeply meaningful.
In Montessori, we call this the “sense of order” - an inner need during the early years. From about 1.5 to 4 years old, children crave order in their environment. It helps them make sense of a big, bustling world.
When we honor this need by offering simple, real-life tasks like organizing shoes, we’re supporting concentration, confidence, and a foundation for independence.
Let them line up the boots. Let them match the shoes. These small acts are big work for growing minds. 🧠💛👣
