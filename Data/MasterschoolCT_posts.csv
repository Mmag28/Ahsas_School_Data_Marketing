"The Lower School concluded the year with Certificate Ceremonies, where teachers honored each of their students by presenting them with a unique certificate of appreciation.

"Congratulations to the 8th graders who graduated into high school at our Grade 8 Commencement! The ceremony included scripture readings and musical performances by students as well as a memories slideshow and students presenting flowers to loved ones they wanted to honor. Middle School teachers spoke about each student, demonstrating just how well-known, well-taught and well-loved they are. 
Eighth grader Acadia addressed her fellow classmates when she said, “Some people say to let go or grow up, but I say no. I say live your life to the fullest, stay young and live. God wants us to value each opportunity we have. These years I have spent at The Master’s School have shaped me, formed me, and put me on the path towards the adult I will be in the future. God has blessed me with this opportunity to be at The Master’s School and with blessed me with the amazing teachers and friends I have made.” 
Eighth grader Grace reflected, “In John Chapter 16, Jesus said this, ‘I have told you these things so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble, but take heart! I have overcome the world.’ He didn’t say it would be easy. He didn’t say we’d know it all. He said we’d have trouble. That we’d struggle. That we’d make mistakes, have to turn around and completely restart. But we don’t have to fear when trouble arises, because that’s not the end of the story. Jesus has already overcome it all, so who are we to worry? Every step of the way, He’ll be by my side, and when I fall, He’ll be nearby to pick me back up. The God who created the entire universe will protect me when I’m faced with challenges I can’t overcome alone.” 
Congratulations to all! May God bless you as you begin high school.",jun 18 25,3,30,1,y
"The Master’s School Class of 2025 gathered with their friends and families at Valley Community Baptist Church in Avon, CT on Saturday, June 7 for the school’s 54th Commencement.
TMS Board Chairman Todd Shelansky opened the ceremony by challenging the Class of 2025 to build habits now to block out the “noise” of the world that drowns out God’s voice and pulls you off the path. “Spend time with God daily in His Word and in prayer so that you are able to hear and recognize God’s voice and His leading,” Shelansky said. “Save, invest, and give generously. Do the hard work in front of you with excellence – it lays the foundation for success.”
Each of the graduates was recognized and uniquely honored by a faculty member who noted the graduate’s admirable qualities, accomplishments, and future plans. Each faculty member also reflected on the special relationship he or she had developed with the student he or she was honoring.
The ceremony included speeches from several students reflecting on their high school experience and thanking their families, teachers and classmates. Class Salutatorian Jayden Martey shared, “I’ve formed friendships I know I will have for years from now, and I’ve had mentors and teachers who saw something special in me even when I didn’t see it in myself. Sometimes all you really need is someone to have your back in order to really change things.”
Ceremony highlights also included both vocal and instrumental student performances, scripture readings by students and a video montage of the graduates during their years at The Master’s School. Each graduate was presented with their diploma as well as their unique Class of 2025 medallion designed by senior art student Abigail Hinds.

Always strive for excellence every day. Do not settle for mediocrity.” Case challenged the Class of 2025 to “connect and care for people, intentionally share positive thoughts, add value to others, and bring salt and light to people repeatedly.”",jun 12 25,3,29,1,y

"Grade 10 World History students stepped out of the classroom and into the fields for an immersive experience on World War I and trench warfare. With the sun shining and a warm breeze, they participated in an outdoor reenactment allowing them to engage with the material in a hands-on way. Students constructed makeshift trenches and took on roles from that historical period, gaining insight into the challenges soldiers faced. 
To enhance the realism, students wore helmets and carried weighted backpacks, simulating all that a soldier had to carry during WWI. The field was transformed into a recreated no man's land, where they bravely navigated their surroundings. To mimic the dangers of combat, they used reusable water balloons as grenades, adding an exciting twist to their strategies. 
Not only did the students have a blast working together and strategizing, but they also cooled down on a hot day, turning learning into a memorable adventure. It was incredible to see their enthusiasm and camaraderie as they brought history to life!",may 9 25,3,21,2,y
