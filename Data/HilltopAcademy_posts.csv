"Hi! My name is Gina Martin-Ryan, founder and director of Hilltop Academy. Like last week, I am sharing this post to introduce myself and share about our school.

What is Hilltop Academy?
We are a new, independent, nonprofit school, opening September 2024, in northern CT. We are enrolling students in grades 3-7 for our first year, expanding with an additional grade each subsequent year. We are open to families from Hartford to Springfield and all the towns in between.
Why Hilltop Academy?
We offer a school program that is different, knowing a conventional approach is not the best fit for every child. We are aiming to broaden access and opportunity for as many families as possible.
What makes Hilltop Academy different?
We offer a holistic, personalized, high-quality education. Our programming is experiential, project-based, interdisciplinary, and done in ways that are more natural for how children learn. We encourage creativity, inquiry, curiosity, play, and exploration. Class sizes are small, creating a nurturing, highly engaging, and academically rich environment. We use more authentic means for teaching, assessment, and learning. Students exercise their voice and choice, participate in community service, and conservation efforts. As a school, we are deeply rooted in connection with our families and our community.
All pathways students are interested in pursuing are honored, whether it's one for college, service, trade, or immediate workforce entry. We ensure every child is prepared with the skills and knowledge they need for today's world to be happy, healthy, independent, and lead a life of purpose.
Interested in learning more about our programming? Opportunities for involvement? How can you support our cause? We are happy to share! Schedule a personal information session today: Go to www.hilltopheroes.org or call 860-544-2225.
Please continue to help us get the word out- share with your friends and family!",apr 7 24,7,35,49,y
Do any of you get curious about abandoned structures? I always do. I want to know the story. We came across this one on our walk on East Granby’s rail to trail. Curiosity satisfied when we spotted the sign! Had no idea!! Grateful for the one responsible for sharing it!!,mar 24 24,0,4,0,y
"So… I did that thing that you should never do—placed my phone on the roof of my car for second and had the thought, watch me forget it there. Sure enough, forgot it.  at some point, my phone flew off the roof, which launched the crash notification—police were notified as were all my emergency contacts. We circled back to where we had driven, searched and searched and could not find my phone even with with the pinpoint location being shown.   No luck! A little while later…
Pictured with me is Tom. He found my phone while riding his bike and got my phone back to me!! I so appreciate you, Tom!! Thank you for going out of your way when you could have chosen differently!!! You are proof that good people do exist!",mar 17 24,0,4,0,y
