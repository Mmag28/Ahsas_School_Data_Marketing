Enfield_Montessori,"The mission of the Enfield Montessori School is to continue the ministry of Jesus by nurturing the whole child using the Montessori Method. The school is sponsored by the Felician Sisters of Our Lady of Hope Province and is recognized as an educational mission of the Church that promotes the spiritual and human development of the child. The school aims to awaken in students a desire to strengthen their communities and the global society. Its philosophy emphasizes not only academic achievement but also the total development of each individual by fostering their spiritual, intellectual, and physical growth. Chiaravalle Academy, the middle school program at Enfield Montessori School for Grades 7 and 8, provides a quality prepared environment rich with applied learning opportunities. Graduates are rigorously prepared for high school. The program includes a resource-rich academic environment, practical applications of learning including internships and real-world experiences, and a focus on building time management, study skills, responsibility, and respectful social behavior. Thank you for considering the Enfield Montessori School for your child. Current research increasingly supports Dr. Montessori’s conviction that the years from birth to twelve are most critical in a child’s life. This gift of a Montessori education is one of the most important gifts we can ever give our children. For over 60 years, EMS has been inspiring students to become passionate life-long learners, problem solvers and innovative thinkers in a compassionate and nurturing environment. Our school is a place where the child’s academic, social-emotional, and spiritual development is nurtured and challenged at every level to help them develop self-confidence, competency, concentration, critical thinking, compassion, and respect. Our goal is to not only fully prepare the child for their next educational experience and beyond but for life. As a Montessori child, parent and teacher myself, I think perhaps the real treasure of the Enfield Montessori School is the sense of peacefulness, community and family engagement that are present in the school. It is clear that this is a community who understands that providing an aesthetically pleasing and academically rich environment is secondary to providing an environment of respect and compassion; an environment where highly trained AMI (Association Montessori Internationale) teachers are passionate about serving the child and helping the child reach the child's fullest potential. I encourage you to learn more about the Montessori philosophy and about the Enfield Montessori School in particular. We would like the opportunity to partner with you and your child during this most important time in your child's life."
Watkinson_School,"In the last three years, Watkinson graduates have been offered 7 million dollars in merit scholarship college aid. Watkinson students succeed in the finest colleges in the country. Colleges want Watkinson students because they are known to think deeper, question harder, and engage more fully as they learn. They know what it means to contribute to a seriously enjoyable learning community. Watkinson’s unrivaled academic programs like Exhibitions, Senior Seminar, and dual diplomas get students accepted into the country’s best colleges. Watkinson graduates are known for the way they speak up, question, analyze, and synthesize complex information. They enter college already demonstrating the skills colleges seek. 100% of Watkinson parents agree that the school is a safe place to learn, where emotional development is supported. International research has shown that happiness correlates with intrinsic motivation and GPA. Watkinson fosters happiness and belonging because happier students learn better. Watkinson has over 100 five-star reviews on Niche.com from parents and alumni who praise the school for helping students discover their potential. Watkinson is a coeducational, college-preparatory day school for grades 6–12 with small class sizes and a 6:1 student-to-teacher ratio. It offers diploma programs in Creative Arts and Global Studies, university classes at the University of Hartford, and a unique PG program for students not yet college-ready. The school draws students from 40 towns and has a diverse student body, with over 30% students of color. Watkinson’s mission is to develop in students the power to shape their lives and the world around them. Schools are always making decisions. They have to set policy about cell-phone usage and dress code. They need to make sure the curriculum stays relevant, challenging, and accessible. They need to figure out how to keep the cafeteria from getting too crowded in the lead-up to lunchtime. Some of these issues are problems, which can be defined and then solved. Other issues are dilemmas: complex situations with no single right answer, questions that raise bigger questions. Clearly, how a school sets about making a decision will depend upon whether they think they’re dealing with a problem or a dilemma. Take dress code. In many schools, dress code is treated like a problem and solved with a set of rules — “Wearing X/Y/Z is not allowed.” Almost always, these rules are established without student input. At Watkinson, on the other hand, we consider dress code to be a dilemma, embedded in a broader inquiry about sovereignty, self-expression, gender and sexuality, and socioeconomics, not to mention existential questions about the nature and purpose of schooling. Since pondering questions like these is at the very heart of a good education, involving students in the conversation is a natural step to take. Of course, in many circumstances, a straightforward rule is an appropriate solution. But when it comes to education — the process by which developing humans strive to become their best selves and shape a better world in the process — we often need something more robust than simple rules. We need intelligent, empathetic, principled complexity. In other words, Watkinson is not set to the default of solving problems as quickly as possible. Rather, the Watkinson culture centers around developing the habit and the ability to ask, “What’s the real issue here? How does it need and deserve to be approached, and by whom?” We create this culture on purpose. We don’t just assume it will happen. Instead, as a community, we develop structures designed to help us practice the skills of thinking, asking, and discerning before we jump into action. This means we won’t make questions unnecessarily complex. On the other hand, we also pay attention to bigger questions when they deserve to be asked. That, for us, is what education is all about. Take a look at the statistics from our recent re-accreditation survey. These results are not trivial. Respect is the foundation of trust, and trust is the basis of taking intelligent risks — which is exactly how growth happens. It’s important to note that respectful relationship-building is not an automatic characteristic of “small school culture.” Yes, smaller class size is essential if every student (not just a few stars) is to develop a mutually respectful relationship with the teacher. But smallness on its own is insufficient. In fact, even an abstract belief in “respecting students” is not enough. Teachers need to put belief in action — to practice respect, not just preach it. You know it when you see it… and when you don’t. A school may call itself “student-centered”, but if there are no avenues in place for developing, hearing, acknowledging, and responding to student voices, then “student-centered” is just marketing copy. Students know an empty promise when they hear it, and don’t bother even trying to speak up. At Watkinson, on the other hand, students can see priorities at work in the way time has been built into the schedule, space has been allocated on campus, habits and rituals both in class and out have been specifically designed to allow students agency in their own education. And so they step up, and they speak out, and they let us know what they care about, and what they disagree with, and what we as an institution could be doing better. They push back. They figure out what they need and they ask for it. They take themselves seriously because we take them seriously — not just theoretically but actually, in practice. It feels better, for students and faculty alike, when people get to work this way. People are literally happier. It’s not that every moment is joyful and easy, but that even the difficulties exist in a meaningful and productive context. People at Watkinson know that they matter. This is why Watkinson’s family retention rate is an incredible 94%, far higher than the national average. And our teacher turnover is so low that it often consists only of a teacher or two who is retiring after 25 years. Because Watkinson’s culture is based on respect for every individual, the school is a dynamic place. Diversity, rather than being seen as a difficulty to be overcome, becomes a necessary resource and inspiration. Disagreement, rather than being taken as a personal affront or a roadblock, becomes a reliable path to better ideas. Students absorb culture, and live up to it. Our seniors collectively receive millions of dollars of merit scholarships for college. Our recent graduates report being better prepared than their university peers in writing, critical thinking, collaboration, and problem-solving. Ninety-nine percent of alumni report being very satisfied with their connection with peers, connection with teachers, and degree of respect from faculty. How do we achieve these results? Watkinson’s culture of intelligent questioning, durable relationship-building, and engaging with complexity come together in the opportunities we create for students to share and reflect on what they’re learning. A visitor to campus will find presentation and reflection in nearly every project and assignment, no matter what grade. We constantly ask ourselves, collectively and individually: “How is this going? What did we learn here? What was the connection between intention and outcome? Can we do this better?” In other words, an essential part of our culture is to examine our culture, making sure it continues to be what we want and intend it to be. This practice of reflection, so fundamental to a Watkinson education on every level, also means that we are better able to respond to problems and complications (like COVID) that arise unexpectedly. Our students absorb and develop these habits. The structures and practice of consistent intention-setting, self-examination, reflection, and iteration serve them well not only at Watkinson but in college and beyond, as they move to shape their own lives and the world around them. Best of all, they’re able to build strong relationships in both their personal and professional lives, taking themselves and others as seriously as Watkinson did. This is truth. We’ve got the stories and the statistics to prove it. But don’t just take our word for it. Come visit campus. Because you’ll know it when you see it."
Magnet_Batchelder,"Montessori Magnet at Batchelder School is the largest public Montessori school in the state of Connecticut and is part of the Hartford Public School system. We are a passionate community of educators and parents who work together to offer authentic Montessori pedagogy aligned with state standards to those who may never have the opportunity to experience the benefits of exercising freedom of choice with guidance. Our state and Montessori certified educators create opportunities for students to design their own weekly work plans from an array of choices. Choice develops executive functioning skills like time management, planning, and task initiation, while giving students the freedom of purposeful movement and voice. Educators ensure all pertinent grade-level standards are reflected in each child’s work plan and provide timely, relevant individual and small group lessons. Each classroom is also staffed with a Montessori-trained assistant so each student is supported in their respective pursuits. Another hallmark of our Montessori classrooms is the multi-age environment. Students of different ages are provided leadership opportunities and peer role models within the same classroom. Students gain necessary skills and grade-level specific content knowledge while learning to be kind, responsible, respectful, and safe. Montessori Magnet at Batchelder School educates the whole child by supporting each student cognitively, emotionally, and socially. Come see the benefits personalized learning with supportive guidance can have on your child!"
CREC_Montessori_Magnet,"At CREC Montessori Magnet School, we are proud to be the first public Montessori school in Connecticut. Our Association Montessori International (AMI) recognition status is the most esteemed affiliation in the Montessori community. We implement these five essential Montessori practices at our school: mixed-age grouping, which fosters independence, cooperation, and discovery; large blocks of uninterrupted time for self-directed work; an environment that allows for maximum freedom of movement and choice; an overall emphasis on intrinsic motivation rather than rewards or punishments; prepared staff who are skilled at observation, preparing an environment, and interacting with children in positive, respectful ways. The Montessori Magnet School provides a national model for excellent public Montessori education. The school serves the Greater Hartford community, offering a traditional Montessori education for students ages 3–12, extended child care for students in the full-day program, and a diverse environment in our custom-built school facility. Students progress academically and socially through an integrated curriculum that combines the Montessori pedagogy with highly effective instructional strategies. Lessons that focus on interdisciplinary and global connections allow students to learn at their own pace and expand their knowledge beyond the school into the greater world. This unique approach to learning pairs high individual challenge with nurturing support. While each classroom has a unique spirit, all are grounded by the core goals of concentration, coordination, independence, and order. Located on the Learning Corridor campus, the school features state-of-the-art facilities, a beautiful campus across from Trinity College, and a diverse student and educator body. In addition to Montessori work cycles, the school offers instruction in visual art, physical education, computer science, library and media studies, and music. Elementary students participate in our celebrated strings program and perform in a chamber ensemble. We serve 355 students in PreK to Grade 6 from 40 towns and cities in Connecticut. The school’s mission is to ensure that all students develop to their full potential in traditional and expanded academic areas as defined by Dr. Maria Montessori’s philosophy. Children remain with the same teacher for an entire developmental cycle lasting three years. Practical life is central to the classroom: children sweep, dust, wash dishes, and use full kitchens equipped with refrigerators, stoves, and dishwashers. These activities help the child adapt, develop self-control, and become contributing members of their community."
Cobb_Montessori,"Cobb School Montessori is an independent non-profit school educating children ages 15 months to 12 years. Nestled in the heart of the Farmington Valley on a beautiful 6-acre campus, Cobb provides a safe nurturing environment for children to meet their full potential. Each of our academic programs is based on the principles of Montessori philosophy to give children what they need at their different stages of development. Our students grow into confident, independent, socially aware learners ready to make a difference in the world. At the start, school was challenging for me because I am dyslexic. I had to learn the very basics of reading which wasn’t very interesting and it took longer than I wanted. However, all the work I did helped build my foundation, and Cobb allowed me some space to take what I was learning and apply it in a more meaningful way. I now find the things that I used to find tedious, like reading, enjoyable. I also learned how to manage big projects that used to overwhelm me. The freedom at Cobb to step away from something and take a break has been very useful in managing stress. I want to thank the Cobb School, my teachers, my friends, and my family for creating an environment that finally made learning fun for me. Cobb is more than a school, we’re a united community that celebrates achievements, supports one another during difficult times, and gathers in friendship throughout the year. Dr. Maria Montessori’s educational method is at the heart of Cobb School. This pedagogy has proven successful for more than a century in tens of thousands of schools around the world. Our faculty members are highly trained and experienced. Their devotion to the students, the parents and the entire community is unwavering. They share a love of learning and passion to educate students. They share a commitment to respecting each child's journey through the stages of development. At Cobb School Montessori, we believe that each child is born to be a learner. The full potential of each student is realized through work in an ordered, challenging, and nurturing environment. Dr. Montessori discovered, through scientifically-based study, that given the proper amount of guidance and freedom children develop a positive sense of self and community. A Cobb Montessori education meets each child’s developmental needs at every level and feeds their passionate curiosity. Our school is a place where individualized attention leads to capable, compassionate children. The result is an education that prepares each child for the complex social, emotional, and academic challenges of middle school, high school, and beyond. We educate our students for life. Cobb School Montessori empowers children to discover their individual and collective potential by fostering independence, academic excellence, compassion, collaboration, and a love for learning. We prepare children to engage thoughtfully and responsibly in an interconnected world through authentic Montessori practices, strong family partnerships, and an inclusive community. We foster respect and compassion for others and the environment. We fulfill the child’s natural desire to become a responsible, contributing member of the family and community. We guide children to become independent, critical thinkers. We provide the foundation to live life with honesty, humility and integrity. Montessori pedagogy is a timeless and leading educational approach, rooted in the understanding that children are naturally curious about the world and driven towards work in pursuit of independence and self-construction. As adults, it is our role to prepare their environment, enabling their independence and guiding them with patience and support. We strive to provide rich experiences and knowledge that satisfy their natural thirst for learning, offering a rigorous and holistic curriculum. When you step into our school, you will witness our children fully immersed in activities of their choosing, working independently. Our youngest students might be found preparing a meal, sewing a pillow, writing in beautiful cursive, exploring the map of Asia, or carefully skip-counting from 6 to 216. Lower elementary students can be seen collaborating on big projects or timelines of the world, solving complex division problems, crafting poetry, experimenting with the states of matter, or intently studying the intricate parts of a flower. Our elders in the upper elementary may be composing a song, making an artful poster about the carbon cycle, analyzing Greek and Latin roots, finding the square root of 53,361, or working on a community service project. You may witness heartwarming scenes of older children compassionately guiding younger ones. A 9-year-old might be found reading to a 4-year-old, while a 12-year-old pushes a toddler on a swing. Our school is a vibrant community where everyone is respected for who they are, encouraged to share their strengths, and dedicated to supporting one another. The goal of Montessori education extends beyond acquiring knowledge; it is about understanding the interconnectedness and inner workings of the world, fostering respect for it, and finding one’s place within it. This education unlocks the full potential of the individual while nurturing them to be responsible members of the community and stewards of the Earth."
Farmington_Valley,"Our mission at The Farmington Valley Academy Montessori is to offer an excellent education characterized by intellectual rigor combined with personal warmth. Dr. Maria Montessori's principles and the insights of other gifted educators form a broad foundation for the school’s philosophy and curriculum. We seek to provide an optimal environment that will serve as a culture that encourages each student to develop to his or her fullest potential across a wide range of experiences. We consider ourselves to have succeeded when we have fostered in each student a sense of respect for themselves and others, an inner expectation of personal responsibility, academic achievement that matches potential, and a love of learning. The Montessori curriculum emphasizes the inter-dependences of life. In the context of a mixed-age classroom, students pursue language, science, geography, history, art, music and theatre. Rather than a fragmented array of special classes, the program challenges students to integrate and synthesize information, identify and analyze problems and develop inquiry and problem-solving skills. We invite you to schedule a tour to discover how FVAM's classrooms excite and immerse learners, foster independence, leadership, grace and courtesy. FVAM seeks to fully prepare students to succeed academically while simultaneously preserving in each student self-confidence, independence and a lifelong love of learning. Students are exposed to many off-campus experiences designed to further enrich their development and help each individual reach his or her fullest potential. Field trips, special subjects, sports and community outreach programs contribute to the optimal environment the school creates. The Middle School Program offers rigorous academic studies and purposeful work that emphasizes the interconnectedness among all academic subjects preparing the adolescent for their high school years. Through both traditional schoolwork and experiential work students develop lasting knowledge, confidence and competence, as well as a sense of responsibility and of belonging. Adolescence is a very social stage of development, a time of camaraderie, friendship and teammates. Relationships are the first priority of any middle schooler. FVAM encourages and fosters peer relationships through collaborative learning and community responsibility. In the classroom, students work together to help each other process, understand, expand and develop dynamic ideas. FVAM's approach focuses on “we”, not “me”. Middle school-aged students confront human nature honestly and directly. They are aware of the powerful complexities and dilemmas of life. Questioning and confronting every issue is characteristic. This emotional engagement presents the possibility for remarkable growth, understanding, compassion and empathy. At FVAM, we encourage students to engage in discussions and debates that lay the foundation for a deeper understanding of a topic. We support and encourage the expression of a wide range of perspectives. It is through these opportunities that students develop the confidence to express their views, be heard and receive responses. Understanding and celebrating different viewpoints brings a deeper appreciation for others and a broader, more compassionate view of the world. Adolescents engage in regular struggles with the question of morality... right and wrong. A Montessori environment offers the opportunity for discussion and guidance to encourage the development of a strong personal value system. At FVAM, moral standards are set at a high level. Mistakes are viewed as an opportunity for further growth and understanding. For our adolescent students, these valuable lessons are the foundation for the human spirit. Just as our younger students learn grace and courtesy lessons, the older child learns beneficial life skills about how to function in the demanding and complex world of higher education and beyond. Through a respectful classroom environment with humanistic values, job sharing, community outreach projects, and annual class trips, such as the Montessori Model United Nations in New York City, we teach our emerging adults the importance of both local and global responsibility. A properly prepared adolescent environment provides an inviting context for social relationships and is a staging area for building a community structure. Relationships connect adolescents to adults and each other, which fosters the occurrence of a higher level of socialization. Through community action, adolescents experience a view of the collective role of humanity and the cosmic task of the individual. They learn to live and work with others, and to contribute. They experience interdependency and cooperation. They learn the reason for rules and laws and how to adapt to societal needs and assume a constructive role in society. This process promotes the development of social consciousness. Adolescents benefit from a dynamic training of character, which leads to the development of a social conscience, a sense of justice and personal dignity. The outcome of strong character development includes a respect for self and others, which is based on the measure of social contribution. It encompasses the willingness to assume responsibility and grapple with social and ethical issues. Moral education highlights the genesis of community values and fosters an understanding of the importance of initiative and commitment. Students often recognize the relationship between their individual growth and the progress of the human community. At FVAM, students learn and work in collaboration with teachers and each other. They share in the work and responsibility of maintaining the many aspects of school life, such as the classroom, the garden, the care of animals, and the care of the environment. Adolescents thrive when they have opportunities that truly engage their strengths. Students often pursue personal interests with commitment and fervor. Curiosity that arises from within leads to intense research and knowledge building. A love of learning is a characteristic of a Montessori education. FVAM offers a broad range of experiences leading students to develop areas of high interest and in turn personal achievement. Each student at FVAM is a unique individual who is in the process of self-discovery. Young men and women encounter many experiences from which they create a personal vision. This vision guides decisions and charts future choices. A personal plan inspires a student to think long term and consider consequences. A middle school student with a goal is a student with a meaningful vision of the future. FVAM provides an environment where curiosity is fostered through interactive learning, where students are encouraged to make independent choices, develop self-awareness and become intrinsically motivated. Guidance and support nurture each individual's achievement. Middle school students are most motivated to learn when their work is useful or purposeful. Direct, active learning is not only engaging but allows the adolescent to self-reflect. Montessori’s syllabus includes opportunities for self-expression, such as linguistic and artistic studies, fulfilled through music, art and theater. The formative studies construct firm foundations for building character. At FVAM, the adolescent's thoughts and ideas are respected allowing them to interact in a more complex, abstract way within the environment. These subjects encompass science and mathematics. General education pertains to the study of the many aspects of history and preparation for adulthood. FVAM emphasizes the student's natural desire to learn. Middle school students are empowered and participate in their own learning process. Teachers are facilitators, guiding students to use meaningful higher-level thinking. Students are exposed to strategies and activities that establish lifelong skills in creative and critical thinking, writing, language, technology, Spanish, Latin, algebra, preparation of presentations, as well as personal and social responsibility. FVAM fosters independent thinkers who are diligent, inventive, thoughtful, collaborative and innovative problem solvers in our constantly changing world."

We believe that salvation is by grace through faith in Jesus Christ. We believe in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit, who lives within and guides believers, empowering them for godly living, and equipping them for service and witness. We believe the Bible is the authoritative Word of God, fully inspired and without error. We believe that God created all human beings in His image. We believe that every person should be treated with love, dignity and respect. We believe that life is eternal for both the saved and the lost. Those who choose salvation by grace through faith in Jesus Christ will live eternally with God and those who reject Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior will live eternally apart from God. We believe in the spiritual unity of believers in our Lord Jesus Christ for the purpose of knowing God and making Him known."
Ahsas_School,"Individualized academics that honor how each student learns best. Integrated with opportunities for students to develop their personal toolkit to sustain their emotional well-being. With the goal of opening our doors to grades 6–8 in September 2026, Ahsas School is a small independent school that will ultimately include grades 6–12 by 2030. Ahsas School aims to provide a holistic, individualized education through a competency-based curriculum. Ahsas School will be a school where people are not 'othered' and everyone truly belongs and matters. Students will learn to trust themselves and discover their unique internal motivations as they navigate the ups and downs of their middle and high school years. Ahsas is the Founder’s name, Sasha, backwards. More importantly, ahsas is a Hindi word that means feelings, oftentimes specifically empathy. While empathy is not the sole focus of Ahsas School, this serendipitous meaning of the name certainly hones in on the heart of our hope for students. Ahsas School will integrate opportunities to develop emotional intelligence and empathy. This holistic approach will enhance academics through the reciprocity between emotional and academic intelligence. Ahsas School admits students of any race, color, ancestry, national origin, and ethnic origin to all rights, privileges, programs, and activities generally accorded to students. It does not discriminate based on race, gender, identity, sexual orientation, learning differences, or any protected category. Inclusivity is a core value and policies will evolve as the community learns and grows together. Key Foundations of the Ahsas School: 1. Mental wellness is paramount. 2. Competency-based learning over traditional grading. 3. Student-led, individualized learning drives authentic academic success. 4. Interdisciplinary learning connects knowledge logically. 5. Mixed-age classrooms are the norm. 6. Nature is a powerful tool for learning and wellness. 7. Belonging, dignity, justice, and anti-bias curricula are central. 8. Play is valuable, both structured and unstructured. 9. Movement enhances cognitive and emotional function. 10. Simplicity is a guiding value. Ahsas School was inspired by the founder’s twin daughters' Montessori education and her work as a Tinkergarten leader. As a licensed social worker, she observed the need for new, developmentally aligned learning models that support adolescents with empathy, outdoor learning, and emotional development. Ahsas is rooted in the belief that middle and high school can be different—and better."
