On June 19, 1865—nearly three years after the Emancipation Proclamation—Union troops arrived in Galveston Bay, Texas, bringing word of freedom to more than 250,000 Black Americans who were still enslaved.

Cobb_Montessori,"A toddler’s quiet joy in lining up boots and shoes isn’t just adorable, it’s deeply meaningful.
In Montessori, we call this the “sense of order” - an inner need during the early years. From about 1.5 to 4 years old, children crave order in their environment. It helps them make sense of a big, bustling world.
When we honor this need by offering simple, real-life tasks like organizing shoes, we’re supporting concentration, confidence, and a foundation for independence.
Let them line up the boots. Let them match the shoes. These small acts are big work for growing minds. 🧠💛👣

Cobb School is bursting with pride for alumna Gracyn Shaw, who has achieved remarkable academic and military honors! Gracyn graduated Magna Cum Laude from Bucknell University with a double major in International Relations and Classical Studies, and a minor in Russian Studies. 
She has commissioned as a Second Lieutenant and Cyber Warfare Officer — ready to defend and serve in the digital frontier. 
 And yes, we’re bragging: Gracyn is also a Distinguished Military Graduate and the 2025 recipient of the prestigious George C. Marshall Award — a true leader among leaders.
Here she is receiving her first official salute — a powerful and proud moment marking the start of her service.
Congratulations, Lt. Shaw! Your Cobb School family stands in awe of your dedication, brilliance, and strength.

Last week's post generated incredible love, support, and interest and our team is so grateful! It has been amazing meeting so many new people!! Thank you so much for every like, share, and kind word 
What is Hilltop Academy?
We are a new, independent, nonprofit school, opening September 2024, in northern CT. We are enrolling students in grades 3-7 for our first year, expanding with an additional grade each subsequent year. We are open to families from Hartford to Springfield and all the towns in between.
Why Hilltop Academy?
We offer a school program that is different, knowing a conventional approach is not the best fit for every child. We are aiming to broaden access and opportunity for as many families as possible.
What makes Hilltop Academy different?
We offer a holistic, personalized, high-quality education. Our programming is experiential, project-based, interdisciplinary, and done in ways that are more natural for how children learn. We encourage creativity, inquiry, curiosity, play, and exploration. Class sizes are small, creating a nurturing, highly engaging, and academically rich environment. We use more authentic means for teaching, assessment, and learning. Students exercise their voice and choice, participate in community service, and conservation efforts. As a school, we are deeply rooted in connection with our families and our community.
All pathways students are interested in pursuing are honored, whether it's one for college, service, trade, or immediate workforce entry. We ensure every child is prepared with the skills and knowledge they need for today's world to be happy, healthy, independent, and lead a life of purpose.
Interested in learning more about our programming? Opportunities for involvement? How can you support our cause? We are happy to share! Schedule a personal information session today: Go to www.hilltopheroes.org or call 860-544-2225.

Sure enough, forgot it.  at some point, my phone flew off the roof, which launched the crash notification—police were notified as were all my emergency contacts. We circled back to where we had driven, searched and searched and could not find my phone even with with the pinpoint location being shown.   No luck! A little while later…
Pictured with me is Tom. He found my phone while riding his bike and got my phone back to me!! I so appreciate you, Tom!! Thank you for going out of your way when you could have chosen differently!!!

Magnet_Batchelder,"On this Montessori Monday, we have Ash working on Place Value with the assistant, Mr. Cale. She’s using the golden beads and the wooden number cards. 
An understanding of the place value of numbers is vitally important to learning operations. It is how we can compare numbers; line up numbers vertically; make sense of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with larger numbers; and is the foundation for regrouping (""borrowing"" and ""carrying"").
In this approach, children use special materials like golden beads, which represent units, tens, hundreds, and thousands.
By physically handling these beads and arranging them in different ways, children can see and feel the relationship between each value.
It’s like building a strong foundation for their understanding of numbers, allowing them to grasp the idea that a number’s value changes depending on its position.

Montessori_Greater_Hartford,"Our little hallway library is full of great reads! 
Featured book- When Charley Met Emma by Amy Webb. 
""When Charley goes to the playground and sees Emma, a girl with limb differences who gets around in a wheelchair, he doesn't know how to react at first. But after he and Emma start talking, he learns that different isn't bad, sad, or strange--different is just different, and different is great!
This delightful book will help kids think about disability, kindness, and how to behave when they meet someone who is different from them""

Over the past several years, MSGH has built a strong partnership with Central Connecticut State University, collaborating with the Music Department, Dance Department, and the Asian American & Pacific Islander (AAPI) Center, all facilitated by Colleen Casey-Nelson, MSGH's Music Director.
Our Upper Elementary students were invited by the AAPI Center to perform the Chinese Lion Dance – SHI WU – at CCSU's Lunar New Year Celebration in New Britain. The room was filled with joy and excitement as our students played their Tiko drums and danced beneath the elaborately decorated lion costumes, a traditional symbol of the celebration. A special thank you to Colleen for fostering our students' curiosity and love for exploration!

Watkinson_School,"At the end of the school year, English teacher Christina Bernbach received this message from a boy in her “Women, Men, and Power” class (one of many English electives for juniors and seniors).  It beautifully demonstrates the power and importance of the humanities.
“This class has been by far the best class I have ever taken, and it’s not even close. While part of it was definitely the people in the class, and the book, I just had so much fun with your style of teaching and the way it worked with this content. My friends make fun of me at lunch when I sit down and say something along the lines of, “That was the coolest class…oh my gosh, I’m shook,” but it’s true. And I say it after almost every single class. The stuff we talked about always gets me thinking about so much bigger stuff than characters in a book, which is like the whole point of English, and school. You’ve got me thinking about the way people treat each other and why that is, and it’s totally translated to my own relationships with people, and the way I act and think.”

“Bakst taught me to be bold with color, texture, and scale. Betak taught me to think beyond the runway — to imagine an entire world, a feeling, a story. Inspired by both, I created three dresses: one representing Bakst, another representing Betak, and the third representing me — and the future that is still being written.

Perhaps you are considering a private school for your student because you know and believe that there are better, more meaningful educational possibilities for them. During our recent New England Association of Schools and Colleges accreditation process, data showed:
• 97.4% of our students agree that their teachers treat them with respect and encourage them to learn
• 96.6 % of our students agree that they are encouraged to think critically and to problem solve
• 96.4% of our parents agree that the school supports the emotional and social development of their child
• In the last three years, Watkinson graduates have received $7 million in merit scholarship aid.

The ceremony included scripture readings and musical performances by students as well as a memories slideshow and students presenting flowers to loved ones they wanted to honor. Middle School teachers spoke about each student, demonstrating just how well-known, well-taught and well-loved they are. 
Eighth grader Acadia addressed her fellow classmates when she said, “Some people say to let go or grow up, but I say no. I say live your life to the fullest, stay young and live. God wants us to value each opportunity we have. These years I have spent at The Master’s School have shaped me, formed me, and put me on the path towards the adult I will be in the future. God has blessed me with this opportunity to be at The Master’s School and with blessed me with the amazing teachers and friends I have made.” 
Eighth grader Grace reflected, “In John Chapter 16, Jesus said this, ‘I have told you these things so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble, but take heart! I have overcome the world.’ He didn’t say it would be easy. He didn’t say we’d know it all. He said we’d have trouble. That we’d struggle. That we’d make mistakes, have to turn around and completely restart. But we don’t have to fear when trouble arises, because that’s not the end of the story. Jesus has already overcome it all, so who are we to worry? Every step of the way, He’ll be by my side, and when I fall, He’ll be nearby to pick me back up. The God who created the entire universe will protect me when I’m faced with challenges I can’t overcome alone.”

The_Masters,"The Master’s School Class of 2025 gathered with their friends and families at Valley Community Baptist Church in Avon, CT on Saturday, June 7 for the school’s 54th Commencement.
TMS Board Chairman Todd Shelansky opened the ceremony by challenging the Class of 2025 to build habits now to block out the “noise” of the world that drowns out God’s voice and pulls you off the path. “Spend time with God daily in His Word and in prayer so that you are able to hear and recognize God’s voice and His leading,” Shelansky said. “Save, invest, and give generously. Do the hard work in front of you with excellence – it lays the foundation for success.”
Each of the graduates was recognized and uniquely honored by a faculty member who noted the graduate’s admirable qualities, accomplishments, and future plans. Each faculty member also reflected on the special relationship he or she had developed with the student he or she was honoring.
The ceremony included speeches from several students reflecting on their high school experience and thanking their families, teachers and classmates. Class Salutatorian Jayden Martey shared, “I’ve formed friendships I know I will have for years from now, and I’ve had mentors and teachers who saw something special in me even when I didn’t see it in myself. Sometimes all you really need is someone to have your back in order to really change things.”
