"On this Montessori Monday, we have Ash working on Place Value with the assistant, Mr. Cale. She‚Äôs using the golden beads and the wooden number cards. 
An understanding of the place value of numbers is vitally important to learning operations. It is how we can compare numbers; line up numbers vertically; make sense of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with larger numbers; and is the foundation for regrouping (""borrowing"" and ""carrying"").
In this approach, children use special materials like golden beads, which represent units, tens, hundreds, and thousands.
By physically handling these beads and arranging them in different ways, children can see and feel the relationship between each value.
It‚Äôs like building a strong foundation for their understanding of numbers, allowing them to grasp the idea that a number‚Äôs value changes depending on its position.
