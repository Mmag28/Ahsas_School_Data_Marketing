"Congratulations to our 2025 winner of the Michael Buda Scholarship. The Buda scholarship is awarded annually to a 6th Year student transitioning from Enfield Montessori and going to Chiaravalle Academy. Students are asked to write an essay explaining how they understand one of our Core Values. MP, pictured here with Ellen & Don Buda and her parents, wrote a stirring piece about Compassion, values we see in her everyday.  So well deserved!  Congratulations and thank you Buda family.",jun 12 25,4,35,0,y

Thank you to all who came to support the children and listen to their speeches! Upper El brought some great biographies to life. One of our visitors asked our Mystery Historians what they were most proud of and the resounding answer was that they cleared the way for others to succeed. 
Well done to our students and to their talented support teams at home too!",mar 12 25,0,22,0,y
"Dr. Montessori, talking about the the first time a child writes spontaneously: 
"" If they had had no ideas, they would not have written. This explosion into writing came suddenly. We could even give the exact time when each child started to write. We could say, 'This little child began to write yesterday at three o'clock. """,mar 7 25,0,3,0,y
