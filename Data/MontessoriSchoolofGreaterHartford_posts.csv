"Our ongoing community art project beautifully captures the spirit of our school! Each of these blue, white and orange wooden flowers represents what MSGH means to someone. Featuring words like family, teamwork, love, kindness, and diversity.
Today, on Spring Giving Day, we celebrate you- and everything these flowers stand for. Every seed truly makes a difference. Each gift given to the Children's Fund today will be a seed added to our dandelion. Will you help it bloom? Click the link in our bio today to learn more and support the Children's Fund. Be sure to comment on this post with a word you would like us to add to our community art project!",may 29 25,0,7,0,y

"Our Lower Elementary and upper-level Primary students enjoyed honoring Holi- as bright, colorful powder flew into the air, we said farewell to winter! Holi is a Hindu celebration that celebrates the arrival of spring in India and the blossoming of love. It is also an invocation for a good spring harvest season. It is important to celebrate our differences and honor diversity!  
Thank you to our parent and family facilitators!",mar 20 25,0,18,0,y
"Our little hallway library is full of great reads! 
Featured book- When Charley Met Emma by Amy Webb. 
""When Charley goes to the playground and sees Emma, a girl with limb differences who gets around in a wheelchair, he doesn't know how to react at first. But after he and Emma start talking, he learns that different isn't bad, sad, or strange--different is just different, and different is great!
This delightful book will help kids think about disability, kindness, and how to behave when they meet someone who is different from them""

"Our Lower Elementary students recently participated in an informative demonstration led by a University of Hartford senior nursing student, focusing on the importance of hygiene and proper handwashing techniques. Following an overview of high touch surfaces and effective handwashing methods, our students applied their newfound knowledge by utilizing a germ simulator to test their skills. Under the blacklight, they were delighted to observe their clean hands, showcasing their mastery of this essential skill. Thank you UHart  @universityofhartford",feb 28 25,0,7,0,y

"MSGH IN THE NEWS! Upper Elementary Students on Channel 8
Over the past several years, MSGH has built a strong partnership with Central Connecticut State University, collaborating with the Music Department, Dance Department, and the Asian American & Pacific Islander (AAPI) Center, all facilitated by Colleen Casey-Nelson, MSGH's Music Director.
Our Upper Elementary students were invited by the AAPI Center to perform the Chinese Lion Dance – SHI WU – at CCSU's Lunar New Year Celebration in New Britain. The room was filled with joy and excitement as our students played their Tiko drums and danced beneath the elaborately decorated lion costumes, a traditional symbol of the celebration. A special thank you to Colleen for fostering our students' curiosity and love for exploration!
