"At the end of the school year, English teacher Christina Bernbach received this message from a boy in her “Women, Men, and Power” class (one of many English electives for juniors and seniors).  It beautifully demonstrates the power and importance of the humanities.
“This class has been by far the best class I have ever taken, and it’s not even close. While part of it was definitely the people in the class, and the book, I just had so much fun with your style of teaching and the way it worked with this content. My friends make fun of me at lunch when I sit down and say something along the lines of, “That was the coolest class…oh my gosh, I’m shook,” but it’s true. And I say it after almost every single class. The stuff we talked about always gets me thinking about so much bigger stuff than characters in a book, which is like the whole point of English, and school. You’ve got me thinking about the way people treat each other and why that is, and it’s totally translated to my own relationships with people, and the way I act and think.”

"Landon S. ’26 describes a recent Creative Arts Diploma Program assignment, “I explored how artists from different eras — Leon Bakst (pre-1950) and Alexandre de Betak (modern-day) — have shaped my identity as an artist and the kind of artist I dream of becoming in the future.
“Bakst taught me to be bold with color, texture, and scale. Betak taught me to think beyond the runway — to imagine an entire world, a feeling, a story. Inspired by both, I created three dresses: one representing Bakst, another representing Betak, and the third representing me — and the future that is still being written.
“This project helped me trust my instincts and learn more about the kind of artist I want to be moving forward.”  #independentschool #privateschool #creativearts #fashiondesign #dressdesign #leonbakst #alexandredebetak #studentartist #hartfordct",apr 24 25,0,23,0,y

"We invite prospective parents to join Head of School Teri Schrader on Wednesday, Apr. 16 at 8am, for coffee and conversation. As the school search often involves questions about affordability, she will be joined by Director of Admission John Crosson and Director of Financial Aid Maricele Riemann who will speak about Watkinson’s financial aid practices.
Perhaps you are considering a private school for your student because you know and believe that there are better, more meaningful educational possibilities for them. During our recent New England Association of Schools and Colleges accreditation process, data showed:
• 97.4% of our students agree that their teachers treat them with respect and encourage them to learn
• 96.6 % of our students agree that they are encouraged to think critically and to problem solve
• 96.4% of our parents agree that the school supports the emotional and social development of their child
• In the last three years, Watkinson graduates have received $7 million in merit scholarship aid.
Join us on April 16th to learn how Watkinson achieves these results. If you plan to attend, kindly RSVP to info@watkinson.org.
