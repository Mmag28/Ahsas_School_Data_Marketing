Hilltop_Academy,"Hi! My name is Gina Martin-Ryan, founder and director of Hilltop Academy. Like last week, I am sharing this post to introduce myself and share about our school. Last week's post generated incredible love, support, and interest and our team is so grateful! It has been amazing meeting so many new people!! Thank you so much for every like, share, and kind word 
What is Hilltop Academy?
We are a new, independent, nonprofit school, opening September 2024, in northern CT. We are enrolling students in grades 3-7 for our first year, expanding with an additional grade each subsequent year. We are open to families from Hartford to Springfield and all the towns in between.
Why Hilltop Academy?
We offer a school program that is different, knowing a conventional approach is not the best fit for every child. We are aiming to broaden access and opportunity for as many families as possible.
What makes Hilltop Academy different?
We offer a holistic, personalized, high-quality education. Our programming is experiential, project-based, interdisciplinary, and done in ways that are more natural for how children learn. We encourage creativity, inquiry, curiosity, play, and exploration. Class sizes are small, creating a nurturing, highly engaging, and academically rich environment. We use more authentic means for teaching, assessment, and learning. Students exercise their voice and choice, participate in community service, and conservation efforts. As a school, we are deeply rooted in connection with our families and our community.
All pathways students are interested in pursuing are honored, whether it's one for college, service, trade, or immediate workforce entry. We ensure every child is prepared with the skills and knowledge they need for today's world to be happy, healthy, independent, and lead a life of purpose.
Interested in learning more about our programming? Opportunities for involvement? How can you support our cause? We are happy to share! Schedule a personal information session today: Go to www.hilltopheroes.org or call 860-544-2225.

Magnet_Batchelder,"On this Montessori Monday, we have Ash working on Place Value with the assistant, Mr. Cale. She’s using the golden beads and the wooden number cards. 
An understanding of the place value of numbers is vitally important to learning operations. It is how we can compare numbers; line up numbers vertically; make sense of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with larger numbers; and is the foundation for regrouping (""borrowing"" and ""carrying"").
In this approach, children use special materials like golden beads, which represent units, tens, hundreds, and thousands.
By physically handling these beads and arranging them in different ways, children can see and feel the relationship between each value.
It’s like building a strong foundation for their understanding of numbers, allowing them to grasp the idea that a number’s value changes depending on its position.

First or best concert? 
Sammy Davis, Jr., Liza Minnelli, and Frank Sinatra at the Meadowlands 
Childhood hero? 
Luke Skywalker 
Favorite day of the year? 
The day in spring when you walk outside, and it’s the same temperature as it is inside

Watkinson_School,"We invite prospective parents to join Head of School Teri Schrader on Wednesday, Apr. 16 at 8am, for coffee and conversation. As the school search often involves questions about affordability, she will be joined by Director of Admission John Crosson and Director of Financial Aid Maricele Riemann who will speak about Watkinson’s financial aid practices.
Perhaps you are considering a private school for your student because you know and believe that there are better, more meaningful educational possibilities for them. During our recent New England Association of Schools and Colleges accreditation process, data showed:
• 97.4% of our students agree that their teachers treat them with respect and encourage them to learn
• 96.6 % of our students agree that they are encouraged to think critically and to problem solve
• 96.4% of our parents agree that the school supports the emotional and social development of their child
• In the last three years, Watkinson graduates have received $7 million in merit scholarship aid.
Join us on April 16th to learn how Watkinson achieves these results. If you plan to attend, kindly RSVP to info@watkinson.org.
